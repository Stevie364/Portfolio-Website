                    <h1>Recursion</h1>
                    <p> <!-- recursion lesson -->
                        When a method calls itself, it is a recursive method. Recursion is often used to break down a complex 
                        problem into smaller and smaller parts until the simplest case is reached. We call this the "base case" 
                        of a recursive structure (a recursive structure may have multiple base cases). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three rules of recursion are:<br>
                        - The method must call itself <br>
                        - The method must have a base case <br>
                        - The method must approach a base case <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be careful as if the method does not have a base case or does not approach it, the method will keep on calling 
                        itself indefinitely, causing a Stack Overflow error where the program has run out of memory to store method calls.

                        Binary Search is a recursive searching algorithm, which splits a dataset in halves until it finds its 
                        target in the middle of the dataset. This algorithm breaks down a larger dataset into smaller and smaller 
                        pieces until it reaches its base case, where the dataset is size 1 and the target must have been found.
