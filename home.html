                        I am currently a student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am interested in every subject under the sun and love learning new things. I like chemistry, biology, computer science, and anything 
                        that is particularly interesting. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am an avid member of the Gardening club, the club that manages Mackenzie's gardens, with many activities spanning from constructing 
                        bird boxes to planting new gardens for the school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am an avid gamer, and I play a variety of games ranging from modern classics like Minecraft to niche titles like Noita. I have thousands 
                        of hours of experience in this subject and am very passionate about it.
