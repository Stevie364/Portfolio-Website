                    <h2>Class Extension</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before, a class acts as a blueprint for an object. 
                        However, a class can extend the function of another class, 
                        becoming a child class, or subclass. A subclass has a "is a" 
                        relationship with its superclass. A subclass will always be a 
                        more specialized version of its superclass or, more specifically, 
                        an extension of it. However, if the class has a "has a" relationship 
                        with another class, the class does not extend the other class. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "example">
                        For example, a Mercedes "is a" Car, and "has a" Door. The 
                        Mercedes extends Car, but does not extend Door. <br>
                        It can still use the methods of Door, however. 
                    </p>

                        These subclasses inherit the methods and variables of the parent 
                        class, or superclass. The subclass is able to access the variables 
                        directly, if they are declared as protected or public, and 
                        indirectly through get methods otherwise. Methods, on the other 
                        hand, can only be accessed if they are declared as public or 
                        protected in the superclass. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To create a subclass, you must use the "extends" keyword after the 
                        class name in the class header. After the keyword, simple put the 
                        name of the class which will become the superclass. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/SubclassExample.png" alt="Subclass Example">
                    <p>
                        Something a subclass can do is override a superclass method. This means 
                        that the subclass creates a method of the same name and parameters 
                        as a superclass method. This time, when the program calls the method, 
                        the subclass override will be used instead of the superclass method. 
                        However, overloads of the superclass method will still work (unless 
                        overrided as well). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A subclass can also specify the use of its superclass methods with 
                        the "super" keyword. This means that you can have an overridden 
                        method and still use the original method in the superclass. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/OverrideExample.png" alt="Override Example">
                    <p>
                        This is especially useful for constructors, as you can make a direct 
                        call to a superclass constructor with "super(parameters)" to set up 
                        the superclass part of the object. Do note that the call must be at 
                        the start of the constructor, and that if a call is not made the 
                        program automatically calls the no-argument superclass constructor. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Abstraction
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Classes in java can be made solely to be extended, which means that 
                        they have abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods which exist 
                        without implementation, which means that they can't do anything. These 
                        abstract methods must be overridden in the subclass in order to function. 
                        Abstract classes may also have regular implemented methods. Abstract 
                        methods are defined with the "abstract" keyword. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/AbstractExample.png" alt="Abstraction Example">
                    <p>
                        Abstract classes cannot be used to create objects, but can be used in 
                        polymorphism. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Interfaces
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Interfaces are purely abstract, with no concrete methods at all. Interfaces 
                        have no constructor, and only have abstract methods. However, methods in an 
                        interface are not defined with abstract, as it is implied that they are. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/InterfaceExample.png" alt="Interface Example">
                    <p>
                        An interface exists for the purpose of pre-defining methods that a class 
                        must have. A class that implements an interface must create a concrete 
                        implementation of all the methods in the interface (unless it is abstract). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interfaces are very useful for polymorphism as all the methods in the interface 
                        must exist within all classes that implement it. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Polymorphism
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Polymorphism is a very strange feature of Java, where you can refer a superclass 
                        (or interface, but I will just be referring to them all as superclasses here) 
                        variable to a subclass object. This means that the superclass reference variable 
                        can access the override methods of any of its subclasses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a superclass variable to be able to access a subclass method, the superclass 
                        must contain a method of the same name (and parameters if it's not an interface). 
                        This is so that the compiler recognizes the method as the superclass method. 
                        However, the actual method is determined in run-time and the program runs the 
                        method of the object the variable refers to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Polymorphism is very useful for running different methods from the same line of 
                        code, by simply switching the object the variable refers to. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "example">
                        For example, a superclass Ball could run roll() on both subclasses Basketball and Baseball.
