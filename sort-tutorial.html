                    <h1>Sorting</h1>
                    <p>
                        Sorting is very useful everywhere, as it allows you to identify patterns and locate individual elements 
                        much easier than in an unsorted dataset. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many different kinds of sorting algorithms, varying in complexity, with some being much faster than
                        others. Two examples of simple sorting algorithms are Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bubble Sort is named after the process in which functions. Bubble sort functions by moving an index from the left 
                        side of the array to the right while swapping the index element and the one to its right if they are not in the right 
                        order. This continues until the array is sorted. <br>
                        What this looks like is elements floating, or bubbling, to the right side of the array. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The time complexity, how many operations the program must perform as a magnitude, is O(n^2). 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
                    <p>
                        Selection Sort works by constructing a sorted array by repetitively taking out the smallest element out of the array. <br>
                        How this works in practice is you have an index for the smallest element found and an index for the constructed subarray. 
                        Iterate through the array comparing the current element to the smallest element index and changing the index if the 
                        current element is smaller. <br>
                        Upon reaching the end, swap the element at the smallest element index with the one at the subarray construction index. 
                        Now you have the smallest index in the first position. Repeat until sorted. 
                    </p>

                        The time complexity of Selection Sort is also O(n^2). However, it performs significantly fewer operations than Bubble Sort.
