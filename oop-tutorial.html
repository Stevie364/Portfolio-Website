                    <h1>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
                    <h2>Objects</h2>
                    <p>
                        <!-- https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp -->
                        Object oriented programming is one of the fundemental precepts of Java, 
                        and understanding it is integral to using the language effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OOP is a type of programming that revolves around objects. Objects in 
                        Java are a lot like real life objects, with attributes (variables) and 
                        functions (methods).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each object, or instance, is created from a class, which acts as a 
                        blueprint for the object, providing it with variables and methods 
                        to use. However, the individual variable values between different 
                        objects of can vary greatly, as each instance has its own set of values.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "example">
                        For example, a football and a basketball would both be objects of the 
                        Ball class.<br>
                        Another example, Bob and George would both be objects of the Human 
                        class
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OOP is very useful for the programming principle of Don't Repeat Yourself, 
                        or DRY, as you can use one Class for many different purposes. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Access</h2>
                    <p>
                        <!-- https://docs.oracle.com/Javase/tutorial/Java/JavaOO/accesscontrol.html -->
                        All datatypes, primitive or Classes, and methods in Java all have an access 
                        level, which defines which other classes can access the thing directly. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p class = "example">
                        Class access means access within the same class. <br>
                        Package access means access within the same package, or defined group of classes. <br>
                        Subclass access means any subclass of the original class. <br>
                        World access means any Class. <br>
                    </p>

		            <h2>Parameters</h2>
                    <p>
                        A method can have parameters, which are variables used in the method that 
                        are given values upon method call. Parameters act as a sort of input for 
                        a method. These are very useful for flexible methods that return 
                        different things depending on their input. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ParametersExample.png" alt="Parameters Example">
                    <h2>Return Type</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each method must have a return type, which is its variable output. The 
                        return type can be void, where it returns nothing. The return type can 
                        also be a primitive type, like int, or an object reference. Each method 
                        may only return one thing, though. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To use a return method, simply call the method wherever its return value 
                        is used and Java will run the method and use the value returned in the 
                        place of the method call. 
                    </p>

                    <!-- THIS IS COMMENTED OUT
                    <h2>Some Types of Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        For another class to be able to access and modify a private variable, a 
                        getter/setter method must be used. A getter method, which is generally 
                        named "get[VariableName]", returns a private variable of the object which 
                        the outside class would not be able to access directly.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, a setter method, which is generally named "set[VariableName]", 
                        takes in a parameter value and sets the private variable to the given value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        [insert code here]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another kind of method is a helper method. Helper methods are private return 
                        methods that assist with the function of another method. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Overloading</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to note about methods is that they can be overloaded, which 
                        means an additional method declaration exists with the same name but different 
                        parameters. These two methods are called the same thing, but can do different 
                        functions. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "example">
                        For example, an area method can be overloaded to take one integer or two integers, 
                        with the single integer input method returning the area of a square with given 
                        side, and the two integer method input returning the area of a rectangle with 
                        given length and width. <br>Void methods can also have overloads. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/OverloadingExample.png" alt="Overlaoding Example">
                    <h2>Constructor</h2>
                    <p>
                        One method that every class must have in Java is a constructor, which runs 
                        upon object creation and does any variable initializing or other things 
                        that the object requires to function. You will have to implement these 
                        things yourself. A constructor is unlike any other method, as it is always 
                        declared as public, and does not have a return type. A constructor may also 
                        have overloaded methods. <br>
                        Sometimes, you want to have basic constructor functions within an overloaded 
                        one. In this case, simply call the constructor with "[ClassName](parameter)" 
                        at the start of the other constructor. <br>
                        One thing to note is that the program will still compile without any defined 
                        constructor. The program assumes that there exists a no-argument constructor. 
                        However, direct calls to the constructor or any overloads will not work. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ConstructorExample.png" alt="Constructor Example">
                    <h2>Class Variables and Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each method or variable can either belong to the class or the individual 
                        object. We call these class or instance methods/variables. Instance 
                        variables are created upon object creation, and each object has a copy. 
                        Class variables, on the other hand, belong to the class and are universal 
                        to all instances of the class. Class methods are similar, belonging to the 
                        class and not the instance object, but they simply cannot use instance 
                        variables. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Class variables and methods are declared in using the "static" keyword, 
                        which comes after the access keyword. 
                    </p>
